## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to center an image. See CSS code below. In addition, I learned how to make a button with a link that lets the user click on any place of the button.

```html
<a href="https://github.com/"><button>GitHub</button></a>
```

```css
img {
  width: 25%;
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  border-radius: 50%;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I will still need more practice on my CSS skills.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This what helped me learn HTML and CSS.
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@BroCodez) - This Youtuber also helped me learn HTML and CSS. In addition, I watched a lot of Youtube videos about HTML and CSS. Youtube is your best friend in learning web development!
